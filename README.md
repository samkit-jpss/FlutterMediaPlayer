# FlutterMediaPlayer

I've created a simple flutter app named mediaplayer with has widgets for audio players and video player. 
You have to download some of the flutter packages from the pubspec packages which I have mentioned in the main.dart file and load it in pubspeck.yaml file mention below.

After implementing these packages we can start our code. I have written complete code in main.dart file which is not a good pratice, But for better management you can create different files.
