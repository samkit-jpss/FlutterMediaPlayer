# FlutterMediaPlayer

I've created a simple flutter app named mediaplayer with has widgets for audio players and video player. 
You have to download some of the flutter packages from the pubspec packages which I have mentioned in the main.dart file and load it in pubspeck.yaml file mention below.

After implementing these packages we can start writing the  code. I have written complete code in main.dart file which is not a good pratice, But for better management you can create different files.

I've created a  _VideoPlayerScreenState Class which Creates and store the VideoPlayerController. The VideoPlayerController , offers several different constructors to play videos from assets, files, or the internet.

After this I've made a dispose function which Ensure disposing of the VideoPlayerController to free up resources.

Then I've created a scaffold widget where we are going to give UI design.
